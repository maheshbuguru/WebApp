                <p>Honey is a sweet and viscous substance made by several bees, the best-known of which are honey
                    bees.Honey is made and stored to nourish bee colonies. Bees produce honey by gathering and
                    then refining the sugary secretions of plants (primarily floral nectar) or the secretions of other
                    insects, like the honeydew of aphids. This refinement takes place both within individual bees,
                    through regurgitation and enzymatic activity, and during storage in the hive, through water
                    evaporation that concentrates the honey's sugars until it is thick and viscous.

                    Honey bees stockpile honey in the hive. Within the hive is a structure made from wax called
                    honeycomb. The honeycomb is made up of hundreds or thousands of hexagonal cells, into which the bees
                    regurgitate honey for storage. Other honey-producing species of bee store the substance in different
                    structures, such as the pots made of wax and resin used by the stingless bee.

                    Honey for human consumption is collected from wild bee colonies, or from the hives of domesticated
                    bees. The honey produced by honey bees is the most familiar to humans, thanks to its worldwide
                    commercial production and availability.The husbandry of bees is known as beekeeping or
                    apiculture, with the cultivation of stingless bees usually referred to as meliponiculture.

                    Honey is sweet because of its high concentrations of the monosaccharides fructose and glucose. It
                    has about the same relative sweetness as sucrose (table sugar).One standard tablespoon (15
                    mL) of honey provides around 190 kilojoules (46 kilocalories) of food energy.

                    French honey from different floral sources, with visible differences in color and texture
                    Honey use and production has a long and varied history, with its beginnings in prehistoric times.
                    Several cave paintings in Cuevas de la Ara√±a in Spain depict humans foraging for honey at least
                    8,000 years ago.[10][11] While Apis melifera is an Old World insect, large-scale meliponiculture of
                    New World stingless bees has been practiced by Mayans since pre-Columbian times.
